== Requirement Class "Tiles Collections Multi-tiles"

=== Overview

[[tiles-cols-multitiles-overview]]
include::requirements/tiles/requirements_class_cols-multitiles.adoc[]

This requirements class defines a mechanism to request more than one tile from more than one collection in a single request. The result can be a document listing the needed tiles to cover a bounding box or a package with all tiles inside. This section shares most of the content with the previous one and intents to provide similar mechanism. The main difference is the capability to request tiles that include elements of multiple collections provided by the parameter 'collections'.

=== API landing page

The landing page provides links to start exploring the resources offered by the API. It mainly consists of a list of links. The core requirement class of this draft specification does not add anything to the links required by OGC API - Common. The collections extension requires new link for the description of the tiles from more than one collection on top of the common ones that is inherited and needed by this extension.

=== Declaration of conformance classes

==== Response

The conformance page mainly consists of a list of links. OGC API - Common already requires some links.

include::requirements/tiles/cols-multitiles/REQ_conformance-success.adoc[]

In the conformance page (typically in JSON format) the links follow the link schema defined in the OGC API - Common. The following is an example fragment of the response of an OGC API - Tiles conformance information page with links to the `collections` requirements class and this requirements class.

=== Tiles description
The response to this operation contains the necessary information to later formulate a tile request from more than one collection as described in the `collections` extension. This requirement class adds an extra link for the multi-tiles

==== Response
A successful response to a tiles request for more than on collection will respond with a data structure with specific information necessary to get tiles representing the resource collection. In this extension, the response informs about the URL template to retrieve multi-tiles.

include::requirements/tiles/cols-multitiles/REQ_mtcs-multitiles-examples.adoc[]

One common order used in URL templates for tiles is .../tiles/{tileMatrixSetId}, but this draft specification allows for other URL template composition.

=== Multiple tiles from more than one collection

This extension provides a mechanism to select and retrieve a set of tiles at once from a TileMatrixSet.

==== Operation

include::requirements/tiles/cols-multitiles/REQ_mtcs-op.adoc[]

==== Parameter tileMatrixSetId
include::requirements/tiles/cols-multitiles/REQ_mtcs-tilematrixsetid-definition.adoc[]

==== Parameter bbox
include::requirements/tiles/cols-multitiles/REQ_mtcs-bbox-definition.adoc[]

This definition in inherited from OGC API - Common.

==== Parameter scaleDenominator
include::requirements/tiles/cols-multitiles/REQ_mtcs-scaledenominator-definition.adoc[]

include::recommendations/tiles/cols-multitiles/REC_mtcs-scaledenominator-definition.adoc[]

==== Parameter multiTileType
include::requirements/tiles/cols-multitiles/REQ_mtcs-multitiletype-definition.adoc[]

include::recommendations/tiles/cols-multitiles/PER_mtcs-multitiletype-definition.adoc[]

==== Parameter Collections
include::requirements/tiles/cols-multitiles/REQ_mtcs-collections-definition.adoc[]

==== Formats
In the cases of the multi-tile response, there are two formats involved. The multi-tile itself can be returned as a package (e.g. a ZIP file) that contains the tiles inside. The individual tile also has its own format. The format of the multi-tile is governed by the format procedure specified in the OGC API â€“ Common draft specification. When the server supports multiple encodings for the individual tiles and the client has a preference for the tiles format, there is a need for communicating this preference to the server. This document does not mandate any particular approach for how this is supported but provides the following recommendation.
include::recommendations/tiles/cols-multitiles/REC_mtcs-f-tile-definition.adoc[]

==== Response
A successful response for a set of tiles will be consistent with the media type of the resource requested. This draft specification does not impose any media type but suggests the use of a package format.

include::requirements/tiles/cols-multitiles/REQ_mtcs-success.adoc[]

==== Error conditions

A general summary of the HTTP status codes can be found in OGC API - Common.

If the parameter value of the parameter `tileMatrixSetId` is not available by the server for this resource or the values of the parameters `bbox` or `scaleDenominator` are out-of-range, the status code of the response will be 404.
