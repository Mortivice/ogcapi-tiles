== Scope
This International Standard specifies how to access tiled data and map tiles in a manner independent of the underlying data store through [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/[https://www.openapis.org/]). This standard specifies discovery and query operations.

=== Current scope:

* Discovery operations allow the API to be interrogated to determine its capabilities and retrieve information (metadata) about this distribution of tiled data and map tiles. This includes the API definition as well as metadata about the data collections provided through the API and the Tile Matrix Sets (also referred to as TileMatrixSets) supported by this service.
* Retrieval of tiles
* Query about a point in a map or a tile
* Retrieval of multiple tiles in a single request
