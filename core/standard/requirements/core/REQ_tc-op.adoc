^|A |The tiles making up a tileset containing available data SHALL be available as an HTTP GET request to a URI that can be built from a template
containing three variables (such as `{tileMatrix}`, `{tileRow}` and `{tileCol}` as defined by the tileset conformance class, or `{z}`, `{y}` and `{x}`).
The URI is obtained by substituting the variables by their respective valid values.
^|B |These variables SHALL correspond to the tile matrix, tile row and tile column of a particular tile matrix set as defined by the 2D Tile Matrix Set standard.
^|C |The API SHALL provide a mechanism to obtain this template and associate the variables to their respective meaning, for example by implementing the tileset
conformance class, or through an API definition.
|===

NOTE: The _core_ conformance class by itself does not prescribe specific names for these variables, nor does it define a specific mechanism to communicate the template.
