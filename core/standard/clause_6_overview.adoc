=== Introduction

The OGC API -Tiles defines building blocks which can be used in an Web API to retrieve geospatial data as tiles that follow the structure defined in _2D Tile Matrix Set_ standard.

This document does not specify any requirement for the type of _geospatial data resource_ that could be delivered as tiles.
Provided that the geospatial data resources can be organized into tiles, they can be supported regardless of whether they are maps, vector features,
coverages, a resource that does not represent data per-se (e.g. an annotation) and so forth.

NOTE: The geospatial data resources replace the concept of layer in WMS and WMTS. The main difference is that layers in WMS and WMTS where not defined by other OGC APIs and did not support other functionalities.

These geospatial data resources can advertise one or more lists of available tilesets (see the _tilesets list_ conformance class).
This specification also defines how two specific data resources can link to such tilesets:
OGC API datasets (see _dataset tilesets_ conformance class) and collections (see _geodata tilesets_ conformance class) but other OGC APIs can provide other possibilities.
Accessing the _geospatial data resource_ content (other than as tiles) or its descriptions is possible out of the scope of this standard.
If a description of the _geospatial data resource_ is specified by another standard, and this description has a mechanism to add links to other resources, this standard indicates the need to add a link to the tile description.

The _OGC API Tiles API_ standard does not specify how to get a Web API definition, the conformance class list or the geospatial data resources lists.
However, the standard assumes that the first two are defined by an OGC API standard (e.g. _OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core_) and the latter by an
OGC API for geospatial data resource (e.g. _OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial data_). A similar definition is provided directly by the _OGC API - Features, Part 1_.

=== Evolution from OGC Web Services

OGC Web Service (OWS) standards have historically implemented a Remote-Procedure-Call-over-HTTP architectural style using Extensible Markup Language (XML) for payloads. This was the state-of-the-art when some of the initial versions of OGC Web Services were originally designed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This architectural style has now a competing RESTful Web API style that is proposed as an alternative to RPC pattern. A RESTful Web API style is resource-oriented instead of service-oriented. The Web Map Tile Service 1.0 already defines a resource oriented architectural style but it lack a Web API definition. This OGC API - Tiles standard specifies an Web API that follows the Web architecture and in particular the W3C/OGC best practices for sharing Spatial Data on the Web as well as the W3C best practices for sharing Data on the Web.

This document provides the necessary elements to incorporate tile support to a Web API implementation. These elements can be incorporated in an API based on the OGC API - Features - Part 1, core or can be incorporated in an Web API implementation based on the OGC API - Common - Part 1, core. Both specify a kernel of a Web API approach to services that follows current resource-oriented architecture practices in the OGC. The OGC API - Common standard provides the foundation upon which implementations of the OGC APIs can be built. The OGC API - common can be combined with this standard and other resource-specific OGC API standards to build an OGC API implementation. However, this standard is done in a way that can extend OGC API - Common, but does not make OGC API - Common mandatory. This way, this standard can be reused as a building block in other APIs that does not follow the OGC API pattern.

Beside the general alignment with the architecture of the Web (e.g., consistency with HTTP/HTTPS, hypermedia controls), another goal for OGC API standards is modularization. This goal has several facets:

* Clear separation between core requirements and more advanced capabilities. This OGC API - Tiles - Core standard presents the requirements that are relevant for almost everyone who wants to share or use Tiled Data on a fine-grained level. Additional capabilities that several communities are using today will be specified as extensions to the Core API.
* Technologies that change more frequently are decoupled and specified in separate modules ("requirements classes" in OGC terminology). This enables, for example, the use/re-use of new encodings for spatial data or Web API definition (such as new version of the OpenAPI description document).
* Modularization is not just about a single "service". OGC APIs will provide building blocks that can be reused in Web APIs in general. In other words, a server supporting the OGC API - Tiles should not be seen as a standalone service. Rather it should be viewed as a collection of Web API building blocks which together implement Tile capabilities. A corollary for this is that it should be possible to implement a Web API that simultaneously conforms to conformance classes from the Feature, Coverage, Map, Tiles, and other future OGC API standards.

This approach intends to support two types of client developers:

* Those that have never heard about the OGC. Developers should be able to create a client using the Web API definition without the need to adopt a specific OGC approach (they no longer need to read how to implement a GetCapabilities, allowing them to focus on the geospatial aspects).
* Those that want to write a "generic" client that can access OGC APIs. In other words, they are not specific for a particular Web API.

As a result of following a RESTful approach, OGC API implementations are not backwards compatible with OWS implementations per se. However, a design goal is to define OGC APIs in a way that an OGC API interface can be mapped to an OWS implementation (where appropriate). OGC APIs are intended to be simpler and more modern, but still an evolution from the previous versions and their implementations making the transition easy (e.g. by initially implementing facades in front of the current OWS services).

=== Relationship to other OGC API standards

The OGC WMS and WMTS share the concept of a map and the capability to create and distribute maps at a limited resolution and size.
In WMS, the number of rows and columns that a map should have can be selected by the user within limits, and in WMTS the number of rows and columns of the tile is predefined in the tile matrix.

With time, the concept of a tile, initially used for _map tiles_ has been generalized to other data models such as feature data (some vendors use the expression _vector tiles_)
and even to coverage data or processes that can be parallelized dividing the space in tiles.
This standard presents an approach to tiles that can be applied to almost every resource type that returns geospatial data.
If applied in conjunction with the OGC API - Features standard and on top of a feature collection, the expected result is tiled feature data.
If applied in conjunction with the OGC API - Maps standard and on top of a collection that is transformed into a map by applying a style,
the result should be map tiles (usually in PNG or JPEG format).

This standard can be referenced by other standards providing resources that that can be offered as tiles. For example:

* _OGC API - Maps_ specifies the link relation types to access map tilesets from a dataset or collection.
* _OGC API - Styles_ defines paths to list available styles from which tilesets can also be accessed.
* _OGC API - Coverages_ specifies the link relation types and specifics of retrieving coverage tiles.
* _OGC API - Processes - Part 3: Workflows and Chaining_ provides a mechanism to trigger localized processing workflows as a result of retrieving tiles (for a specific area and resolution of interest).

This document is the first part of a series of _OGC API - Tiles_ "parts" that use the core and extensions model.
It is foreseen that future parts will specify other extensions, such as how to get information of a point in a tile and how to retrieve multiple tiles in a single request.
Other standards or extensions of standards may also provide mechanisms (e.g. additional query parameters) to deal with time, elevation and other dimensions.

=== How to approach an OGC API
There are at least two ways to approach an OGC API.

* Read the landing page, look for links, follow them and discover new links until the desired resource is found
* Read an Web API definition document that will specify a list of paths and path templates to resources.

For the first approach, many resources in the Web API include links with _rel_ properties to know the reason and purpose for this relation. The following figure illustrates the resources as ellipses and the links as arrows with the link _rel_ as a label .

There is still a third way to approach an OGC API that consist on assuming a set of predefined paths and path templates. It is expected that many OGC API implementations follow a predefined set of paths but this is not mandatory. Be aware that this paths are not required and are used only as examples in this document. An OGC API implementation should provide an Web API definition document (e.g. OpenAPI) detailing the paths and path templates can be used to get the necessary resources directly.

NOTE: Despite the fact that full path and full path templates in the previous table are used in many implementations of the OGC API - Tiles, these exact paths are ONLY examples and are NOT require by this standard. Other paths are possible if correctly described in by the Web API definition document and the links between resources.
