^|*Permission {counter:per-id}* |*/per/tiles/core/tc-multilayer-tile*
^|A |This draft specification does not impose any limits on the number of data layers that are included in a single tile. The server is therefore allowed to return a tile consisting of multiple data layers, where each individual data layer, or the set of data layers as a whole, may correspond to a collection.
