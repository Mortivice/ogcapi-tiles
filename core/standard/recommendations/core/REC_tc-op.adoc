^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/core/tc-op*
^|A | A tiles implementation SHOULD consider to use the tiles URI template variables in the following common order and form: `{tileMatrix}/{tileRow}/{tileCol}`
^|B | A tiles implementation SHOULD consider to specify the variables `{tileMatrix}` even if there is only one valid value for them.
|===

NOTE: Clients should not assume the common order of URI template variable and should extract them from the examples in the "links" section or from the API description path templates.
