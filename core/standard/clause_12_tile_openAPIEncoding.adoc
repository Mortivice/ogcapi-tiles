== Requirement Class "OpenAPI Specification 3.0" API definition

=== Overview

include::requirements/requirements_class_oas30.adoc[]

This conformance class defines the OpenAPI Specification version 3.0 mechanism to retrieve a description of the API in this format

=== Web API OpenAPI description

The OpenAPI definition provides a description of the complete list of API resources. Reading this description, an application will have the full picture of the resources that the API provides, how to retrieve them, and what responses are expected for successful and unsuccessful requests. Without this API description an application will be forced to traverse all links starting by the landing page to get an equivalent full list of resources.

The _OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core_ (_oas30_) requirement class provides many details on general requirements that this requirements class adopts by dependency. In addition extra requirements are provided. Also, the _OGC API - Common_ requirement class provides details on how to request an API definition.

==== Response

===== Completeness
The OpenAPI definition resulting as a response of this request need to take into consideration the relevant resources specified in this standard.

include::requirements/oas30/REQ_completeness.adoc[]

===== Reusable API components

Reusable components for creating OpenAPI definitions for implementations of this OGC API can be found in http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/tiles/part1/1.0/openapi

A server implementations of this OGC API can use the content in the openapi folder to generate a response for the openapi description. The opgapi-tiles-1.yaml includes paths and components. An implementation should only include the path that are implemented and remove the references to the rest. The components part includes parameters, responses and schemas that can be reused as-is. The `api` folder contains json files that are templates with enumerated values for collections (all, coverages or vector), styles, tileMatrixSets. A particular implementation of this API should enumerate the actual resources exposed by the API in the same way. The server can select to dynamically implement responses to /api/* (where * is replaced by all-collections, styles,... ) or hardcode the /api/* files with the actual list of resource identifiers in the enumerations.

To improve performance, the whole content of this folder can be bundled in a single document by executing a tool such as swagger-cli. This can be served for the OGC API - Common - Part 1 `service-desc` link from the landing page.

===== Path Operation Ids

The OpenAPI definition provides to a client application a set of paths that the client can use to interact with the API and get new resources. The OpenAPI description of each path provides a description of some parameters to use in the request and what to expect in the response. However this standard is not proposing a fixed set of path so there is an issue identifying the requirements classes pertaining to each path in an API instance. In other words, the OpenAPI description alone does not provide enough information and there is a need to identify the requirements classes pertaining to a resource (a path) and complete the information necessary for the client to implement the necessary logic to generate the request and understand the response. This standard proposes a suffix mechanism to be applied to the `operationId` property of the path to list the requirement classes pertaining to each path. Each path should have a unique operationId suffix, so it is expected that the OpenAPI instance provides a prefix to the proposed suffixes that make each operationId unique.
