[big]*i.     Abstract*

The OGC started a focused effort to extend their service standards into the Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA) world. As part of this effort, this standard defines a web Application Programming Interface (web API) for tiled data and map tiles. The web API described in this standard builds on the Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) OGC standard. WMTS provides scalable, high performance services for web based distribution of cartographic maps. WMTS, in turn, complements earlier efforts to develop services for the web based distribution of cartographic maps. In particular, it compliments the OGC Web Map Service (WMS). WMS focuses on rendering custom maps and it is an ideal solution for dynamic data or custom styled maps (combined with the OGC Style Layer Descriptor (SLD) standard). WMTS trades the flexibility of custom map rendering for the scalability possible by serving of static data (base maps) where the bounding box and scales have been constrained to discrete tiles. Note that a web API version for serving maps is also part of this development. Whereas WMTS focused on map tiles, the OGC API - Tiles standard has been designed to support any form of tiled data. For example, the API can support map tiles, vector tiles, tiled gridded coverages and other tiled data.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

This document defines the OGC API - Tiles standard. A web API conforming to this standard can serve tiles of spatially referenced data or maps with predefined content, extent, and resolution. Suggested additions, changes and comments on this standard are welcome and encouraged. Such suggestions may be submitted using the online change request form on OGC web site: http://portal.opengeospatial.org/public_ogc/change_request.php
