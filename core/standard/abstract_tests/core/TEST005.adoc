^|Test Purpose |Verify that the response to a successful execution to a tiles description includes the required tile URI templates.
^|Requirement |/req/tiles/core/sct-tile-examples
^|Test Method |1. Verify that the content of the response to a successful execution of a tile description includes at least a link to a tile URI template (rel: item).
2. Verify that the links provide a URL template with the fragment /tiles followed by the variables {tileMatrixSetId}, {tileMatrix}, {tileRow} and {tileCol}. 
3. Verify that there is a link to a tile URI template for each file format that the server supports (the format is indicated in the 'type' attribute of the link).
4. Verify that a property 'templated' is part of the link properties to indicate that the link needs to be processed to substitute the templated variables with valid values before being used as a URL to a tile.
